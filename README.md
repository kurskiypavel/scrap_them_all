# Scrap them all!
The web app “scrapes” (i.e. find and retrieve) its information from choose URL

## Requirements
* Build a web app that displays Ontario cabinet ministers in a single page – head shots
and ministries.
* Show the information for cabinet ministers separately, by selecting vertical tabs on the
left. The intention would be to display a panel of information for each minister, with fast
switching using the tabs. For this project the only information required is head shot and
ministry. See the graphic under “Mockup” below, for a graphic of what your page might
look like.
* The web app must “scrape” (i.e. find and retrieve) its information from
https://news.ontario.ca/cabinet/en.
* The “scrape” must happen at runtime, so that as ministers are added and removed from
the Ontario cabinet, your page will always be up to date.
* This specification is not rigid. Feel free to modify the approach, or extend it, if you wish.
